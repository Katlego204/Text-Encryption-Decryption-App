# Text-Encryption-Decryption-App
A simple yet functional GUI application built with Python and Tkinter that allows users to encrypt or decrypt text using the classic Caesar Cipher technique.


Features
	•	Encrypt & Decrypt text using a shift key
	•	Userfriendly graphical interface (built with Tkinter)
	•	Option to include or exclude non-letter characters
	•	Live input/output with realtime result display
	•	Prints user input, key, checkbox status, and action to terminal (for debugging or demo purposes)

How It Works
The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption method where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

This app takes:
	•	A user_input message
	•	A numeric key (the shift)
	•	An option to encrypt or decrypt non-letters (like punctuation and spaces)
